# Planning Workflow

This folder contains planning documents for new features and changes.

## Creating a New Plan

1. Create a new file with a descriptive name: `feature-name.md`
2. Include these sections:
   - **Summary**: Brief description of what you're building
   - **Why**: The problem this solves or value it adds
   - **Implementation**: Step-by-step approach
   - **Files to Modify**: List of files that will change
   - **Testing**: How to verify the feature works

## Example Plan Template

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Summary
One sentence describing the feature.

## Why
Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve?

## Implementation
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.py` - What changes

## Testing
- How to test this feature works
```

## Completed Plans

Move finished plans to `/plan/completed/` to keep this folder focused on active work.

## Tips

- Keep plans concise - focus on the approach, not exhaustive detail
- Update plans as you learn more during implementation
- Reference plans in commit messages when relevant
